# SideScroller
State Transitions in unity. Side Scroller Game 
Contains several animations and transitions. Some of the states include:
-Idle
-Run
-Walk
-Jump from Standstill
-Running Jump
-Ledge grab
-Pull up

The gameplay consists of a character(controlled by the player), platforms to jump on and coins to collect.
The player wins if they collect all coins without falling off the platforms.
A special sound is made to indicate when all the coins are collected

3 scripts in total were used.
1) Script ‘CharacterContorls’ was used as a controller script for the player object.
2) coinCollect script is to collect the in-game objects to get the final win condition
3) Ledgehang is implemented in part with a separate script by the same name and used
again in the main player controller script to get the player position and disable the controller
while the player is on the ledge.

Run "Sidescroller.exe" to play
